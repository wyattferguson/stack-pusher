# :joystick: Stack Pusher

A remake of the classic flash game ores with Pyxels. This project is basically a rough demo, that I would like to port to the Gameboy in the near future.

[Play in your browser](https://wyattferguson.github.io/)

## Gameplay

Stop the blocks from being pushed of the screen! Destroy touching blocks of the same color to earn points towards leveling up. When you level up the screen restarts, but gets tougher every level. If the blocks go off the left side of the screen you lose.

## Controls

```
W,A,S,D - Movement
F - Push stack forward
Space - Select a block
R - Restart Game
P - Pause Game
```

# Installation & How To Use

Installation is pretty straight forward, Im using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage everything.

First if you dont Poetry installed run this:

```
pipx install poetry
```

Then install the dependencies with:

```
poetry install
```

To run it simply:

```
poetry run python ./stack_pusher/stack_pusher.py
```
